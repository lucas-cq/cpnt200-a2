## Code Review
Nuxt seems like an easier way to get an actual website running so far. Im excited for the JS part. I found this a lot easier to get into than Tailwind but I bet they work nicely together. I cannot say the same for starting it in github pages though, I forgot "npm run build" and it took me a couple hours to realise that.
