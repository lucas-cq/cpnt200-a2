## Code Review
Getting started with netlify was interesting for sure. At first it was easy deploying but when widgets came around that changed. As with everything in this course it looks very intimidating at first. But then when you start reading about it, it becomes very easy. I like the widgets in netlify, especially the map one and color one.
